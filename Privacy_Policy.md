Privacy Policy

Effective date: March 1, 2024

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how I (Zija) (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "I", "we", "us"), as the developer of the MotoCom (the "App", "Application"), collects information when you use the App. This Policy also explains how we use and disclose the information collected from you, and your rights in relation to that information. 

MotoCom is an open-source, free application developed by Zija.

1. Acceptance

Please read the policy carefully before you use or access our App. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree with our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in the following sections. Please note that if you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you must not use the App.


2. Amendments to this Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2024. 
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes or updates to the policy will be reflected on this page with the updated effective date.

3. Information We Collect

We do not collect any information from users of the App. Any data entered or generated within the App remains solely on your device and is not transmitted to us or stored by us in any form. The App facilitates peer-to-peer voice communication between connected devices, and any information exchanged during this process is limited to the direct communication between devices. Specifically, when two devices establish a P2P Voice Connection, the App utilizes the microphone to record voice, transmitting audio data directly to the connected device for immediate playback. It's important to note that no audio data is stored in any file, and it is immediately discarded after transmission to the receiving device. The App utilizes Hotspot/WiFi Connection to establish P2P Voice Connections and operates primarily in offline mode, ensuring that no external data collection or transmission occurs.

4. Information Third-Party Collects

The Application does not connect to any Third-Party Servers/Apps/Links. Therefore, there is no Third-Party Collection.

5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information, particularly from children under 13 years of age. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise and guide their children's use of digital services, including our MotoCom App. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us at markozjalicdev@gmail.com

6. Security

We take the security of your data seriously. While the App does not collect or store any user information, using unknown, compromised or malicious WiFi/Hotspot could potentially be risk for your information. We advise users to exercise caution and use trusted networks when using the App to ensure the safety and privacy of their data.

7. Debug Data

The Application does not collect or store any debug data. We do not utilize any bug reporting services. Should you encounter any issues or bugs while using the app, we encourage you to report them directly to us via our GitHub project page: https://github.com/zjalic/MotoCom/issues. Your feedback helps us improve the MotoCom app for all users.
